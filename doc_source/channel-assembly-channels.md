# Working with channels<a name="channel-assembly-channels"></a>

A channel assembles your source manifests into a linear stream\. Each channel contains one or more outputs that correspond to your package configurations\.

 First you create a channel, then you add your VOD sources and live sources to the channel's schedule by creating *programs*\. Each program is associated with a VOD source or a live source\.
