# What is AWS Elemental MediaTailor?<a name="what-is"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaTailor is a scalable ad insertion and channel assembly service that runs in the AWS Cloud\. With MediaTailor, you can serve targeted ad content to viewers and create linear streams while maintaining broadcast quality in over\-the\-top \(OTT\) video applications\. MediaTailor ad insertion supports Apple HTTP Live Streaming \(HLS\) and MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP \(DASH\) for video on demand \(VOD\) and live workflows\.

AWS Elemental MediaTailor ad insertion offers important advances over traditional ad\-tracking systems: ads are better monetized, more consistent in video quality and resolution, and easier to manage across multi\-platform environments\. MediaTailor simplifies your ad workflow by allowing all IP\-connected devices to render ads in the same way as they render other content\. The service also offers advanced tracking of ad views, which further increases the monetization of content\.

AWS Elemental MediaTailor channel assembly is a manifest\-only service that allows you to create linear streaming channels using your existing video on demand \(VOD\) content\. MediaTailor never touches your content segments, which are served directly from your origin server\. Instead, MediaTailor fetches the manifests from your origin, and uses them to assemble a live sliding manifest window that references the underlying content segments\.

 MediaTailor channel assembly makes it easy to monetize your channel by inserting ad breaks into your stream without having to condition it with SCTE\-35 markers\. You can use channel assembly with MediaTailor ad insertion, or another server\-side ad insertion service\.
