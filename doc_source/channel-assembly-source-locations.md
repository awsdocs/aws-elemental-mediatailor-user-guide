# Working with source locations<a name="channel-assembly-source-locations"></a>

A source location represents the origin server where your source content is stored\. A source location can be Amazon S3, a standard web server, a content delivery network \(CDN\) such as Amazon CloudFront, or a packaging origin such as AWS Elemental MediaPackage\. MediaTailor retrieves your content manifests from the source location, and uses them to assemble your channel's linear stream\.

 This topic explains how to use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor console to create and delete source locations, and how to work with VOD sources\.
