Each program contains a VOD source that's part of a source location in your account\. You add your programs to your channel's schedule to control the order that they play in your channel's stream\.

A program can be configured with one or more ad breaks\. Each ad break contains a slate, which is a VOD source from a source location\. To create the ad break, you add the slate at an offset in milliseconds into the program\.
